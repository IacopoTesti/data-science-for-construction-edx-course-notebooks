# The Colab/Jupyter Notebooks for the EDx Course [Data Science for Construction, Architecture and Engineering](https://www.edx.org/course/Data-Science-for-Construction-Architecture-and-Engineering)

This repository is a mirror of the notebooks used in the course that are available from the [Google Drive for the course](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12u6frOf-EMcmqpZumwtvUIvucWgH1OZX). We try to keep it updated for the participants who don't have access to Google drive.
